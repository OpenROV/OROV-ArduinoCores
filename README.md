# OpenROV Custom Arduino Board Core Packages

This repository contains Arduino-compatible board cores for OpenROV custom MCU board designs. Right now, the primary focus is on development of a core package for the SAMD21J18A for use in the OpenROV Controller Board Firmware project, but we will also be creating a custom core for our various AVR board implementations.

This is still a work in progress and is not yet ready for use general use, but it has been successfully used to build a working blink program on a SAMD21J18A using ArduinoBuilder and BOSSA in our internal development environment.
