# ROVDUINO Core for Atmel's SAMD21J18A CPU

This repository containts the source code and configuration files of the Rovduino Core
for Atmel's SAMD21 processor (used on the OpenROV Experimental Controller board).

This is still a work in progress and is not yet ready for use publicly in Arduino projects, but it has been used to build a working blink program on a SAMD21J18A using ArduinoBuilder and BOSSA in our internal development environment.
